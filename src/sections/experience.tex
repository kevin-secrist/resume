                        \item Ported a Ruby tool for managing data from several heterogeneous data sources to a new extensible dotnet tool and added new features including code generation. This accelerated the ability to offer hundreds of Office 365 products and add ten to twenty new products per month as well as allowing more developers with C\# experience to further enhance the tool.
                        \item Implemented a data-driven object model for presenting product information to customers that enables filtering on combinations of dimensions to create adjustable hierarchical categorizations of products without additional code or deployments.
                        \item Designed multiple proof of concepts of PowerShell on Azure Functions to run scripts against thousands of customer environments per day for security reporting and metric gathering.

                        \item Began work on a new Office 365 Control Panel in Azure App Services using React, ASP.NET Core, and Azure Functions allowing developers to focus more on business logic than infrastructure.
                        \item Started a proof of concept leveraging Elasticsearch as a write-through cache for slower Microsoft APIs and later implemented it for increased searchability and dramatically better performance from 5+ seconds down to less than 100 milliseconds.
                        \item Created new patterns for encrypting sensitive information within asynchronous workflows to reduce boilerplate code in secure transport of user data.
                        \item Implemented new asynchronous workflow patterns using Durable Functions, enabling highly complex workflows with high resiliency and scalability. These workflows are used to provision several thousand licenses per month.
