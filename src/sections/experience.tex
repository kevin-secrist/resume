                        \item Responsible for refining product requirements, delivering on the execution and deployment of solutions, software development life cycle, and architecture of stack for a 10+ person development team.
                        \item Key developer of a growing Office 365 business since its beginning in 2014, generating over \$4M recurring monthly revenue in 2019.
                        \item Interviewed and on-boarded several new developers as part of initiative to more than double current team size. Included domain knowledge training, pair programming, and business analysis.
                        \item Designed a distributed authorization model that encompasses Office 365 built-in roles, Rackspace customer authorization, and custom business rules. This model is secure, scalable, and highly flexible allowing client-side to have incredibly fine-grained knowledge of the capabilities of the logged in user as well as server-side being able to quickly validate the user's claims.
                        \ifcv
                        \item Ported a Ruby tool for managing data from several heterogeneous data sources to a new extensible dotnet tool and added new features including code generation. This accelerated the ability to offer hundreds of Office 365 products and add ten to twenty new products per month as well as allowing more developers with C\# experience to further enhance the tool.
                        \item Implemented a data-driven object model for presenting product information to customers that enables filtering on combinations of dimensions to create adjustable hierarchical categorizations of products without additional code or deployments.
                        \item Designed multiple proof of concepts of PowerShell on Azure Functions to run scripts against thousands of customer environments per day for security reporting and metric gathering.

                        \item On-boarded developers from other teams to bootstrap a new team to work on Office 365 and taught domain-specific knowledge to kick-start development.
                        \item Began work on a new Office 365 Control Panel in Azure App Services using React, ASP.NET Core, and Azure Functions allowing developers to focus more on business logic than infrastructure.
                        \item Started a proof of concept leveraging Elasticsearch as a write-through cache for slower Microsoft APIs and later implemented it for increased searchability and dramatically better performance from 5+ seconds down to less than 100 milliseconds.
                        \item Created new patterns for encrypting sensitive information within asynchronous workflows to reduce boilerplate code in secure transport of user data.
                        \item Implemented new asynchronous workflow patterns using Durable Functions, enabling highly complex workflows with high resiliency and scalability. These workflows are used to provision several thousand licenses per month.
